Gamification SaaS is a platform for adding gamification features—like points, achievements, and leaderboards—to any website or app. Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and .NET 9, it provides a plug-and-play SDK using web components, a modern admin dashboard, and secure JWT-based authentication. The project focuses on easy integration, multi-tenant support, and developer-friendly documentation, making it simple to add engaging game mechanics to any frontend stack.
