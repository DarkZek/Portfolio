The days of browsers being a image and text rendering engine are gone, the web is constantly evolving and browsers are becoming more and more capable of running complex applications.

Browsers have been hard at work in the last couple of years trying replicate native platform technologies in a safe and restricted manner to allow us to make games, but not allow malware to exploit. Here's a collection of what they have done

### Assembly -> WebAssembly

<BaselineStatus id="wasm" />

WebAssembly, commonly known as wasm is a binary instruction format similar to assembly that runs in the browser,
allowing developers to write code in any language and compile it to WebAssembly. 
WebAssembly has great compatibility with all major browsers and allows us to port existing projects to the web, as well as
use a single codebase for both native and web applications.

It is important to note that WebAssembly does not provide platform api's that almost any game will need, such as
audio, input, graphics, networking, threading, etc. These all need to be specially handled for web which is where Web APIs come in.

### Vulkan -> WebGPU

<BaselineStatus id="webgpu" />

WebGPU is a graphics API loosely based on Vulkan and Metal that is designed to be a low overhead graphics API
that can be used to render graphics in the browser. You may be asking "Don't we already have [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)?" and you'd be right,
WebGL has
[many](https://discussions.unity.com/t/webgl-vs-desktop-unity-vs-js-engine/932348)
limitations and problems with driver differences causing compatibility problems and poor performance of GL that WebGPU solves.

WebGPU still lacks all of the bells and whistles of a full graphics API like Vulkan or DirectX, such as 
[Mesh Shaders](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/3015),
[Hardware Ray Tracing](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/535),
[Bindless](https://hackmd.io/PCwnjLyVSqmLfTRSqH0viA?view)

The Chromium team is always hard at work improving WebGPU, give their blog a read if you're interested in the latest updates.

### std::thread -> WASM Threads

<BaselineStatus id="shared-everything-threads" />

WebAssembly is single threaded, meaning that you can't create new threads in WebAssembly like you can natively in C++ or Rust.
Proposals for being able to spawn threads in WebAssembly are currently still in the [draft proposal stage](https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads).
This is the largest blocker for many games that rely on multithreading for acceptable performance as it means everything must be
on the main thread.


##### Web Workers to the rescue (sort of)

<BaselineStatus id="js-modules-workers" />

Web Workers are a way to run another copy of your code in a separate thread, this will work for some limited use cases.
Web Workers initiate an entirely new copy of your application in a separate thread, which is only able to communicate with the main
thread through a slow `postMessage` request or a [shared buffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer).
This is okay for large chunks of work done occassionally but is no substitute for a real threading api. 

### UDP Stream -> WebTransport

<BaselineStatus id="webtransport" />

Browsers support a variety of real-time networking api's:

- [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
    - Uses TCP which has a high latency penalty
- [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)
    - Does not leave enough freedom to game as it handles media encoding, reliability, and are hard to make servers for.
    - Shout out to https://quic.video/blog/replacing-webrtc/
- [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)

These each have their own problems, but WebTransport is built for this problem!

WebTransport is built on top of HTTP/3, with HTTP/3 utilising
a new UDP based transport protocol named [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic/) which is the key to its low latency and high throughput networking.

This solution is high performance enough that games are able to use the same endpoint as native clients with a native QUIC library.

WebTransport works by opening 'channels' between one client and one server where either uni, or bi directional buffers of data are able
to be transmitted.
