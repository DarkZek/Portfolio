## Flixr

Flixr is a sleek and intuitive platform designed for getting reminders about your favourite TV shows. Finding out a year too late that your favourite show had a new season air can be a frustrating experience, so I created flixr. You enter the shows you're interested in, and flixr will send you a notification when a new season is released.
