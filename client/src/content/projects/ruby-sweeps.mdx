## Ruby Sweeps

Ruby Sweeps is an innovative online gaming platform created by Ruby Play Network
for customers in the United States.
This commercial-level application was developed to provide an online experience for players who enjoy
in-person social gaming to experience the same level of fun using their mobile devices.

#### My Role
In my role as software engineer and UI designer for the project, I was tasked with refreshing the user
interface. The previous design was difficult to use and confusing to navigate, especially on mobile devices.
To address this issue, I created mockups for a mobile-first website that was clean, smooth, and unobtrusive.
Over the course of several months, I gradually transitioned the interface to a new design, culminating in
the release of version 2 of the application. This update was met with very positive reviews from users.
Since then, I have continued to work with other team members to add new functionality and improve features
as the product evolved.

#### Features
Ruby Sweeps offers a variety of features to enhance the gaming experience, including the ability
to accept donations through various payment providers, facilitate online gaming, and provide
rewards and jackpots to players. With its user-friendly interface and exciting gameplay options,
Ruby Sweeps is quickly becoming a popular choice for online gaming enthusiasts in Alabama.
