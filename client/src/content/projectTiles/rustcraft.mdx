RustCraft is a hobby project delving into High Performance low level software.
Written in Rust and using wgpu-rs, it focuses on delivering <u>high performance</u> voxel rendering.
It features an Entity Component System (ECS) based rendering system, threaded networking,
mesh building, asset management, <u>render engine</u> and AABB physics engine
with the goal of making performance problems in voxel games a problem of the past.
